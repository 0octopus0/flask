you need to  ceate a  separte media player using  html  and the other styling options are optional
the  concept is simple we put all over midia content in in a div and add a switch with  id  and  put a unique id for each media content
then put a simple js code for when a user click the button then the js function take the buttton id  and then the js functoin take the id and it will sent into our python backend
the backed will decide which item will show to the user based on the id 

code instructions

note: we didnot use any database for this so we put our all media files in flask folder -> static -> videos/images 

other doubts are clear when you see the code
